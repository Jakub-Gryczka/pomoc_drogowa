#Roadside Assistance Website (pomoc-drogowa.lukow.pl) - commercial project
It's my first commercial website made for real company. The client wanted to refresh his actual website and I volunteered to make it. The aim of the project is to attract clients for roadside company. I made a design for the website in Figma as well as provided domain, hosting, sitemap and used Google Search Console to test the app in terms of SEO, responsiveness etc.
##Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- JAVASCRIPT
  I was planning on using Sass or Tailwind, but I decided not to use technologies I know well in commercial project.
