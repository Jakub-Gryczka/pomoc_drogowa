# Roadside Assistance Website (pomoc-drogowa.lukow.pl) - commercial project

It's my first commercial website made for real company. The client wanted to refresh his actual website and I volunteered to make it. The aim of the project is to attract clients for roadside company. I made a design for the website in Figma as well as provided domain, hosting, sitemap, used Google Search Console and PageInsights to test the app in terms of SEO, responsiveness etc.
During building a project I learned a lot especially about git, because now I know I have to make separate branches for each new functionality. I also leart a lot about domains, hostings and SEO. I didn't have a clue about things like backlinks, DR, UR, sitemaps, indexing, follow links, nofollow links, canonical website etc. The project also taught me some performance on website, I leart about Image CDN (Imagekit.io), Critical CSS, lazy loading and much more. The project was really fun and I hope it will help get more clients for the company.

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- JAVASCRIPT
- SEO

  The project is build in plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript, no need to run builds or installing on local machine.
  I was planning on using Sass or Tailwind, but I decided not to use technologies I know well in commercial project.
